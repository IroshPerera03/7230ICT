"YouTube","A man or person is truly strong and confident when they do not fear seeming/being weak anymore. When they can be good and nice and with God on their side, feeling always protected, not needing to show off or looking strong by scaring or insulting others. True power doesn&#39;t need to consolidate its position through petty theater where they treat the others mockingly. True power knows its endlessness, its persistance, its resistance, its unbreakability, its source and does not need to offer proof, demonstrate or convince. Still, impressive things are welcomed :) it&#39;s nice to impress each other now and then, showing what we&#39;re able to do",3,9,6,6,9

Mainly because I mostly listen to female artists and am not an Ed Sheeran fan. The music video compliments the songs lyrics and meaning so well in my opinion- he tries to find love and does by sharing it with a female love interest through a sport. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve really seen a music video like that before. Great idea (Posted September&#39;s 27, 2025)",6,6,0,3,2

Like I watched this vid 20 mintues after it was initially posted publicly. The views were like around 20-30k. I was 17 years old at the time and I thought this song flopped. I remember liking it, but I just thought it flopped at the time. I do hear this occassionally being played on events and radio stations but I didn&#39;t think much of it over the years. 8 years later, I scrolled to a youtube shorts to find out that this song got 6 Billion views. I was shocked. I don&#39;t know, I find this boring story cool enough to share. It&#39;s nothing really important, it&#39;s not life changing. But the fact that I thought Shape of You flopped for 8 years straight is just bewildering to me, to say the least.",7,8,1,3,5

"YouTube","Praying Everyone has different beliefs. Some people pray and some people don&#39;t pray. I believe man is God. I believe in the universe. I also believe in the sun. The sun is a part of the universe and provides vitamin d for humans. The sun is much bigger than the earth. Also the sun provides energy for plants. The sun doesn&#39;t judge anyone, it just shows up in the sky. Also without even seeing the sun I know it&#39;s real because I can feel the heat on a hot day. The sun is very powerful. I believe the universe will provide me with what I need. The universe is big and powerful so I have faith in it. Ask the universe for what you want and put the work in when needed. So how do we pray to the universe? The universe responds to how you feel. It&#39;s really important that you feel good. The universe responds to this vibration. - Focus on what you are greatful for, including the little things. - Visualize what you want and feel yourself having it. - Think about what you want. - Write down and read about things you want. - Trust your instincts (instincts are ususally right most of the time). Trust your instincts as long as you don&#39;t hurt anyone else. - Ask the universe for what you want - Do things that make you feel great about yourself. - Do things that make you feel happy. - Make a vision board with pictures on it of things you want. - If you aren&#39;t sure what you want I recommend visualising Gold, gold is valuable. - You could also visualise golden light healing your body or something else you want (light giving you adrenaline for example) You could also visualise white light healing your body, white represents purity. - If you aren&#39;t sure what you want pray for the FEELINGS and EMOTIONS you want. - If you aren&#39;t sure what you want pray for oppotunities for the feelings and emotions you want. For example if your bored with life start praying for oppotunities to find healthy ideas for excitement. Start exploring different options and hopefully you find an exciting activity. If your angry in life work on your attitude and pray for oppotunities to find the calmness your need. Don&#39;t get desperate when praying. Pray, have faith in the universe and yourself. Yes put the work in when required, this is very important aswell. Try one or all of these ideas above and see how much better your life will become. If you have a different idea that works then great, keep using that. In times of stress do healthy and appropriate things to take your mind off the situation and improve your mood. During times of stress focus on all the little things you are greatful for. You could spend some time each day visualising what you want. There are many oppotunities to do this within the day. You could write down things you want and visualise them. You could write down things you want and imagine GOLDEN LIGHT making the things you want a reality (I recommend this if you don&#39;t know what it looks like in your mind when trying to visualise what you want). Light is very powerful and very fast. Pray in a positive way. For example instead of praying, &quot;I don&#39;t want to see people go hungry&quot;, pray for people to have enough to eat. Instead of focusing on your debts, setup repayment plans and focus on prosperity and wealth. Some more examples I don&#39;t want to be alone, so what do you want, a companion who is good company and likes you. I don&#39;t want to be sick, so what do you want, a healthy body that is strong. I don&#39;t want the elite to control people, so what do you want, peace and love and happiness for everyone. Lets say you want a woman but don&#39;t want kids, so what do you want, a beautiful woman without kids. Don&#39;t even think about having kids if you don&#39;t want kids. Saying things in a positive way can make you feel better about the situation. You could also ask the universe for what you want. For example &quot;Universe I want a healthy heart&quot;. Now sometimes you will feel negative during your life and this is ok. Sometimes a little negative energy or stress in the body is good to keep you motivated. Sometimes negativity and stress can be great as a warning sign, example drinking too much alcohol and having a hangover. This feeling tells the body to slow down on the alcohol. When exercising your body is put under stress but there are many health benefits associated with exercise. Now if you feel negative and stressed for too long this is not good for the body. The body and mind struggles to deal with too much negativity and stress. Trust me I know. Great examples are holding onto anger for too long about a certain issue. Also abusing drugs and alcohol puts the body and brain under lots of stress. Now when under stress I recommend trying to get happy again. Easier said than done, I know. The universe responds to how you feel and positive thoughts are much more POWERFUL than negative thoughts. For example if you are feeling bad about people suffering when watching the news, maybe don&#39;t watch the news anymore or could you work out a solution to help. If you can&#39;t do nothing to help maybe you could pray for them to get better. At the very least you could listen to some feel good music to make yourself feel better about your own life for the moment. Sometimes the best thing is to just let go of the situation and think about happy things or just move on with your life. Sometimes we can hype up things in our mind too much. If this happens maybe try to think about calming thoughts and slow your body down. Also if you want a partner and they don&#39;t want you try to let go to reduce your own stress levels. There are plenty of people in the world. If your waiting for a meal and your complaining that&#39;s what you get more of, the waiting. Why because you are focussing on the waiting. Try are focus on something positive or be thankful for the money to buy the meal. You could be thankful for other things in your life aswell. I have faith in the universe. Sometimes work is needed to change your life. Example - getting healthier and working on improving fittness Everyone needs to work no matter what the situation in life is. Controlling emotions requires work. Without good emotional control life will be tough no matter how much money you have. Great examples Rich man with drug and alcohol problems Rich man with anger or depression Rich man who suffers from boredom or lonliness Remember this statement 10 percent is the situation, 90 percent is how we react Example blaming a spouse for being lazy with household chores and getting angry at them. Maybe have a calm chat and compromise with household chores. Also a solution could be hiring a butler. Also try to appreciate the good qualities he or she has Also try to focus on things that make you feel good so you don&#39;t hold on to the anger for as long, I believe this is very important for your mental and physical health. Sometimes getting angry lets off steam, you don&#39;t always want to keep everything bottled up inside. It&#39;s ok to show emotions, it&#39;s just what we do with the emotions and how we react to these emotions that determines our quality of life in my opinion. You may not achieve everything you want or get everything you want but remember developing a strong mindest is invaluable. Having a strong mindest will help you in every situation in life I believe. How to give yourself a better chance to get what you want and have a well balanced life Being positive most of the time Visualising what you want Focusing on what you want Looking after your health Managing your emotions in a healthy way PATIENECE IS REQUIRED WHEN PRAYING TO THE UNIVERSE AND WORKING ON YOUR GOALS I BELIEVE HAVING A STRONG MINDEST IS AN ADVANTAGE IN LIFE AND GIVES YOU A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF HAVING A WELL BALANCED LIFE Remember when you aren&#39;t feeling good it&#39;s really important to find a way to make yourself feel better (without hurting anyone else and ideally don&#39;t hurt yourself). It&#39;s even more important to keep doing the little things to improve your mood and well being. Remember when you aren&#39;t feeling good it&#39;s really important to find a way to make yourself feel better (without hurting anyone else and ideally don&#39;t hurt yourself). It&#39;s even more important to keep doing the little things to improve your mood and well being.",34,52,18,26,28

But even so I will say this but this is my opinion and my alone I cant speak for other but I will say for any major artist especially now and especially looking at ticket prices over the past 2 years! I will say even though they went up in price I will agree they are still pricer than normal but probably the cheapest of all ticket prices for ANY major artist! But thats just what Ive noticed and I concerts are my thing! Yeah they are more expensive but like if that was like any other artist I feel it would be 3 to 4 times the prices! Not kidding but that just from personal experience and observation! Anyways good luck with your tickets and you never know you may get lucky! Ive gotten a last minute ticket once for 2nd row it wasnt for ed Ed and I know they retailed for over 900 a piece before fees and I got it for 105 like 10 hours before the show! So you never know!

I was really hoping he had the rotating stage again as I loved sitting further up in the stands and knowing that he would rotate by eventually each song. 

The floor is a pain at Gillette as they let everyone go up to get food and stuff but then it takes like 40 min to go back down... meanwhile they could just take a set of stairs to the edge of the stage and make that down only...

But regardless of seats, im excited! This will be my 5th time seeing Ed!

"Reddit","I honestly really hate how the promo/singles of Play are being handled. I get releasing a song or two as singles in the months leading up to an album's official release. That makes sense. But this whole concept of literally releasing half the album before the official release date just does not sit well with me and it honestly has kind of put a damper on my excitement for Play. I actually really enjoy the experience of binging an album's track list once it comes out. And it's nice to know one or two of those songs ahead of time. It's such a special moment to press play on a tracklist of 12+ tracks and experience the whole thing new at one time. (I mean Subtract in numerical order is essentially a whole narrative of Ed and his family's journey through that tough stretch and wouldn't nearly have been as inpactful or meaningful if half the songs had randomly been released beforehand!). But with Play we already now have essentially half the album (and most likely the half that is expected to be most popular. Think A side tracks vs B side tracks theory). 
I think this kind of release schedule honestly kind of hurts Ed and the album in the long run (and maybe even loop tour). Sure he can bank all of the streaming numbers and money from merch drops now before the album has even officially come out, but what's this going to mean when Play finally releases? The market (fans, streaming) have now been so oversaturated in Play promo, singles, and merch for months that by the time the rest of the album drops next month, is ""anyone even going to care""? (To put it bluntly). 
And in some ways I could even see the argument being made against Ed saying that this type of singles releasing makes him look desperate and even is a bit of a money grab. 
This is just my own unpopular opinion. But I really hope that by the time we're coming up on the next album that Ed and his team have had a good think on the subject and do not follow this same pattern again.",4,13,9,9,11

"Reddit","I love ed but it feels like that his recent releases are all about dancing in a club. I loved him for the way he conveyed  true feelings through his songs, but it happens less and less.

Even though he claims he isnt now, there was a time he embraced chart topping, as said by the song Tides from Equals.

The other unpopular opinion I have is that Ed actually never did try to replicate the success of Divide. He had yet to make an album that is full of what couldve been singles. Divide was an album full of songs Ed claimed couldve been a single. None of his *solo* albums since have been that. People claim Equals but thats just not true when you have songs like Sandman on it.",1,3,2,1,2
"Reddit","Perfect is overplayed =-",1,1,0,1,1
"Reddit","The success of Shape of you was the undoing of Eds ability to write unique lyrics and the beginning of The Brand. 

Firstly, Ive been a die-hard since about 2010. All the EPs, all the albums, and I love him. This is the man who got me into songwriting, so credit where credits due. 

I remember being completely infatuated by his early lyrics- especially from SIWWA right up until the deluxe versions of X. There was a rawness to his storytelling- you could really feel the emotion in his vocals. The production wasnt too overwhelming and managed to just amplify these amazing amazing songs so much so that they are still perfect to listen to. 

Then Divide drops, the world goes crazy and he becomes this almost ubiquitous figure- and not just in music. Hes everywhere. SOY plays about 100 times on any radio station and he becomes inescapable. That marimba line is one of the most recognisable melodies in modern pop and I love it at the same time as I hate it, because lyrically, its a weak song. 
Granted, it got people up and dancing, and the Fresh Meat reference was an ode to Britishness, but for me it just lacked everything I fell in love with. 
Perfect was always going to be a hit, but even that didnt feel like it had half the soul of Wake me up, photograph or Afire Love. It had no vulnerability. 

No6 had some great collabs but there was nearly a video every other week, and I feel like people were kind of like thanks for the songs for the summer and it was relegated to the shelf. 

Then = is announced and I have hope. Hope which is snatched as soon as I hear Shivers. A great bop, but the lyrics felt so bland it was like pop-music-korma. Overpass Graffiti is brilliant but it should have had the same type of production quality as Nina because the triple guitar tracking was too much, but the lyrics felt personal- finally! 

- was an absolute belter, and one of my favourite releases to date. The lyrics were poignant, heartfelt and you could really finally feel the man behind the music again. However, I still think for an acoustic album, the production quality was over the top. He should have recorded that album with Jake Gosling, as he did with +, not Aaron Dessner. Almost like the studio said this is great, but we still need it to be semi-commercial 

Autumn Variations gets an honourable mention, and Plastic Bag should have done something commercially- the only song with great lyrics which could have fared well had it had the overproduction of all the other singles. 

Right now, Azizam and sapphire have been okay to listen to when they appear on shuffle, but I am LIVING for A little more. It feels authentic. It doesnt meet the universal convention of a good pop song, but IT IS! Its tongue in cheek, its funny, the lyrics are honest- its great to hear Ed Rap again and its a breath of fresh air. Its been on repeat constantly. 

I sound like Ive come to shit on an entire decades worth of work, but thats not the case at all. I love Ed, I just believe that Shape of You has had him shackled for 8 years in the pop machine, and hes finally starting to break free, which is liberating as a listener.",15,25,10,12,14

Ora, ascoltando le sue cose dopo Equals, sembra proprio come qualsiasi altro artista pop che senti in classifica. Non fraintendetemi, amo ancora la sua musica e la sua voce incredibilmente versatile, ma lo capiscole persone cambiano nel corso degli anni, e così anche la loro musica.

Onestamente, sono solo contento che sia felice con la sua famiglia e che faccia musica che lo fa stare bene.

I had written a song with a friend of mine and I was super happy with it but I'm so glad we spent (and are still spending) so much time having it ""on the shelf"" to go back as time goes by and make little adjustments to make it sound the most heartfelt, relatable whilst also personal possible.

Even the rhythm is the same and whilst I'm 99% sure it was a coincidence because the notes are common value, it has common instruments, common rhythm, etc. I just cannot listen to that song without thinking of the marching band song lol.",2,6,4,4,4
"Reddit","I think it's my favourite instrumental drop he's ever done.",1,1,0,0,0
"Reddit","Honestly, I think as a lead single, its way too short.

I dont like short songs in general, but I REALLY dislike short songs that are lead singles. 2step, sure, its a little bottle rocket song that wasnt a lead. But its a fun little song.

But Azizam needed a bridge imo, its way too short and sometimes the bridge can really make a song: Shivers bridge for example is amazing.

Really, really needed to be longer tbh. 

I kind of hope this album isnt catered to TikTok short viral songs. I dont think Ed will do that but I miss long 3, even 4 minute lead songs

Azizam just sort of feels half finished due to lack of bridge. Its fun and light, but probably my least favorite single of his.

And I like the way the song sounds btw, i really just wish it was longer. I do think itll crawl up the charts come the next few weeks",4,7,3,4,5

Its punchy, simple and upbeat. It doesnt have substance but it also doesnt feel as focused grouped and impersonal as some of his other singles can feel. When he gets too in his head about who the audience is or where itll be played. Shape of You, Galway Girl and Bad Habits are my least favourites.

Autumn Variation showed me he could still do personal acoustic pop and Equals was a return to form in my opinion in regard to his pure pop work. So Im honestly optimistic to see where the rest of the album goes.",1,3,2,0,1

Like there isn't that extra spark keeping me coming back to his newer work. I listen once and it's a done deal. 

Been a fan since the Red Tour. 

I think it's fair tbh. He'll always be the soundtrack to my teens at least, but that je ne sais quoi just isn't there for me anymore, and it hasn't been there for a while if I'm being honest. 

I still root for him tho, and want him to succeed. He comes off as a genuinely nice fellow. My music taste has definitely shifted...a lot.",7,8,1,4,4
"Reddit","Im right there with you. I absolutely love him as a person, and have always felt, and still believe, that he is one of the most talented musicians out there.

I hope people dont hate on this take, because I think its a very real part of loving a musician. Getting downvoted already, though.",7,8,1,5,6
"Reddit","Also getting downvoted lol.

Mine isn't even a scenario where I wish he'd go back to his acoustic roots and recapture that spark (that's pretty much impossible), plus he did 2 lo-fi albums back to back that had some incredible writing imo.

I think it's a normal part of growing up tbh, expanding your sonic palette and what not. He is definitely one of the most talented musicians out there. He can wield a pen quite a bit but I feel like his arc as an artist pretty much culminated? If that makes sense. He was a lost teenager dealing with young heartache, the addict in his 20s working harder to make it big, the global superstar that had the highest grossing tour ever, the man that settled down, got married and had kids, and the man that dealt with painful loss and came out alive in the end.

5 is another great album that I feel like doesnt get the love it deserves!",2,2,0,1,1
"Reddit","Same boat! I think it sucks for us fans to outgrow an artist's musical journey when you love the artist first and foremost lol. His newer and coming hits (Equals, Play) are great bangers. But like you, I connected the most with his older works. Except with Subtract though, this lad carried me through my relapses.   
  
But I guess that's just how things go. Plus Ed won't come back. The edgy multiply won't be coming back. His discography has changed because he's in a better environment now, and he wasn't as rugged as before- buskin all night and grinding for years.  My theory is that, or as obviously, because of this mega success and acclaim he's gotten these late years (all love to ed), there's no intensity anymore in his albums- no sheer musical hunger, and that is not an insult to his recent music at all.",0,5,5,5,2
"Reddit","I remember as a kid, I always only thought he was okay but now I really like him lol.

That being said, I really like the Zac Brown Band as well, they are my favorite. But when I was kid I listened almost exclusively to country music, Simon and Garfunkel, and top 40 sounding stuff.

As for the song,I like it but it's not playing a lot with the lyrics even for pop songs standards.and it's biggest problem is that it's short, maybe a rap verse or something would've made this better.or he should've released the full farsi remix as the main song.",0,5,5,0,0

"Reddit","Well if thats the case no need to get there before check in time. I would think maybe 2 hours. Since theres a performance at 9&  thought it would be much intimate and smaller but its seems like a big space, all good. No complaints here Ill take it lol",1,2,1,2,2

Pretty sure Ed has called him out before, and he completely crumbled and back tracked before making multiple TikToks when he found his spine again",7,9,2,4,6
"Reddit","I'm a Taylor Swift fan and she has some annoyingly basic pop songs AND 2 minute songs.

Meanwhile he sings ""you color and fracture the light. And I know that you carry the world on your back.""

Also, my Dad who's a big music fan and Zac Brown Band fan even said he thinks Ed is a better lyricist than Zac. =- I agree on ZBB's two newest songs though.
