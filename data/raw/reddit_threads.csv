2025-09-15,1757945564,Some Critical Thoughts on Play,"Ive been looping Play nonstop since release and honestly Ive loved almost every song individually. But listening as an album, I do have a few critiques I wanted to share  not out of hate, but out of love, because I really think Ed was this close to making a great album for us fans and also in sense of critical accomplishments. ( I know he don't care ). 

 The slow ballads issue:

There are three slow, stripped down ballads. Slowly, For Always, and In Other Words. Dont get me wrong, I adore each of them in isolation. Theyre classic Ed. Very intimate, vulnerable, timeless. But when you put them together on the same album, they dont add much diversity. It feels like we get multiple flavors of the same type of song rather than each filling a different emotional role. Just think about in other words, it really hurts for saying it because I love it so much, but when you hear Camera, a beautiful love song with powerful vocal work and great production, and then in other words, another plain love song, more stripped down which doesn't add much for the album. Again in other words probably one of the most prettiest song on the album but if you think wholly about the album, I think it would be far better if it was in the extended version. Although there are two more slow ballad, but at least slowly and for always have a much different and more personal topic to discuss on. Also there is actually enough love songs on the album but they are very different in vibe. Like Vow is groovy, almost cheeky still about love but with lot more swagger. Heaven is very much production-driven, with a heavenly beat and those gorgeous backing vocals that give the album a beautiful closure. So these are actually justified about including in the album. So I think with the ballads, Ed couldve swapped one out for a track that added more emotional or sonic variety and I think leaving in other words in the deluxe edition would have been a great choice.

 The absence of Regret:

This one stings. Regret is one of the best songs Ed has written in years, and its stuck on the deluxe instead of the standard. The lyrical content which juggling family and work and his daughters, missing out on moments, struggling with guilt actually hits so deep. Its the kind of brutally honest song that grounds an album. Someone said in YouTube comments that Ed has created his own mockingbird and it could not have been phrased more accurately. 

Think about Multiply. As much as we all love the bangers, the album wouldnt feel the same without The Man. That track anchored the whole project with raw honesty about his life and frustrations at the time. Without it, I don't think Multiply would have achieved that height.

Regret is that song for Play. If it had been on the standard edition, it wouldve elevated the record from just a fun , playful project to a great experimental but also personal album. I have already saw many people talking about Opening as the best song on the project really shows what people actually want to hear more.  


 About Symmetry:

I loved the concept of Symmetry using Indian beats, just like Sapphire and Azizam bring in cross-cultural sounds. Sonically, its exciting and totally in the spirit of an album like Play. But my issue is  lyrically, it  felt very surface-level. The writing across Symmetry, Azizam, and Sapphire almost blurs together. They showcase style and production, but dont really go as deep into Eds personal life as his best songs do. I mean there were already sapphire and azizam about radio hits, I really think a little more effort on the writing for symmetry would really be great.

I love Play. I think its vibrant, adventurous, and full of great individual songs. To be honest, I wasn't much hopeful about this after listening singles like Azizam and Sapphire. But for me as an album, it falls just short of being a masterpiece because it has too many ballads in the same emotional lane, some experimental tracks leaned on production more than personal lyricism and including some tracks like regrets or even wargame or  freedom in the standard edition would have elevated this project to a different height.",EdSheeran,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/1nhmyzl/some_critical_thoughts_on_play/

2025-06-06,1749168093,I dont like play so far .,"Im not trying to be a hater, love Ed and am proud to be a fan. I just feel like his songs are trying to be too relatable. I know he said his focus on this album was making it fun or making songs that he had fun making but idk. I feel when I listen to what hes released it feels like hes trying to fit into different sounds. I feel hes been doing this since divide but I think divide still had a lot of his personality at least. I understand Ed is in a different part of life and so maybe thats why resonate with multiply and divide more. At the same time I just feel he putting words to paper and finding catchy melodies. The words dont feel personal it feels like songs that anyone can relate to. 

When I think of why I love multiply I think of photograph and the last line of the song, I will remember how you kissed me under the lamppost back on 6th street it feels direct or very personal. Songs like dont, the man, Nina, runaway, and afire love all those songs feel like you personally had to live Eds life to write them. These new songs dont feel like Ed. They feel like writing songs that anyone can relate to. Like what would be the most relatable story to tell. 

When I hear songs like the man or Nina, like I said I dont think anyone can relate to those songs 100% I think the only person who could have wrote those songs was Ed himself. They are his experiences. I couldnt relate to them 100% but I can take pieces of it and resonate that to my own life. I miss how direct his songs were. 

I dont think its all been like this, certain songs I think still show Ed. For recent work I love visiting hours, welcome to the world, a lot of songs on subtract specifically stoned, curtains, end of youth, and for autumn I loved page and and punchline, I know autumn variations is about his friends and not him directly. 

Idk I could be bugging Im grateful for any new music but I just want something more raw. I understand his last big album was subtract so a lot of grief and pain in that and likely wants to transition to more uplifting songs. I just want it to be personal. Feels like hes trying to capture another hit single like shape of you but the spark is lost in generic lyrics. Shape of you versus felt so personal it felt like a story. All these recent songs feel like the lyrics and melody are all pretty but what they are saying is generic.  

Azizam lyrics 
 I wanna get lost in your ocean and drown
I wanna be careless and free
I wanna live here in the moment we found
I wanna be all that you see

Nothing feels personal. Lyrics are nice and pretty but to me it feel like adding beautiful colors to a bad drawing.

What do you guys think? Like I said Im not trying to hate Im just trying to say what I feel about recent drop. Old phone is good but I wish he had gotten into what those conversation in the phone were. Or talked about photos he had of a ex and where it was. We wouldnt be able to relate to what he is saying since those are his experiences but it wouldve felt more personal.

2025-09-12,1757707506,Dont get the hate for Play from music critics,"I read through a few reviews AFTER I finished listening to the extended version. Sure, Im a fan, but aside from that, I felt like the critics were unduly harsh on not just the album as a whole but on each song and on Ed as an artist. 

A few samples: 

Rolling Stone: ED SHEERAN PLAYS ON  BUT ITS THE SAME OLD SONG

The Independent: A musical buffet lacking a signature dish

NME: A hasty retreat to the genre-spanning of old

The Times: The one-man Coldplay returns

The Telegraph: Why Ed Sheeran will never be one of the all-time greats

Perhaps they dont understand that Ed makes his music for the love of it and not just to top charts. Hes as pure an artist as you can get in this day and age of manufactured music, with singers streaming and boosting sales non-organically. 

It was a little jarring to read these pieces after listening to him baring his heart on Opening to the ballads we melt for like For Always and The Vow. And how he shares his life with the world on his terms, like on Camera and Old Phone. And of course, the bangers like Sapphire and Azizam.  

While I ponder, time to hit Play again!

Lyrically, emotionally, and sonicallythis is Ed at his rawest. No pop polish, no chart-chasing, just pure grief and vulnerability poured into a mic for Jamal into those bars, it's one of the most powerful things hes ever written. This isnt just another sad track. This is catharsis.

But it absolutely baffles me the way it's criminally underrated. It don't even have 3 million views on YouTube.You see Taylor Swift or One Direction reaction videos even after all these years casually pulling 6070k views while I saw f64 reaction videos barely getting 10k views. I even couldn't find more than 2 reaction videos of one of his biggest album - Multiply!!! I get that he has a lot more casual listeners than hardcore fan but come on!!Were talking about one of the biggest artists in the worldand yet some of his deepest, most meaningful work barely makes a ripple in the algorithm.

It makes you think: Ed may be massive, but songs like F64, No 5 collaboration projects, Songs I wrote with Amy, Loose Changes are hidden gems that don't even get close to the flowers they deserve. And people keep sleeping on Ed Sheeran as a normal pop star.

Idk how he's calling it yet, Mathematics and Math Series was such a brand but I'm sure he'll find something.

Since the start of his career, he hasn't done one album in the Math Series that *didn't* have at least one rap or hip-hop influenced tracks or with rap verses(U.N.I., Grade 8, The City, YNMIDNY on +; Sing, Don't, Nina, Bloodstream, Runaway, The Man, Afire Love, Take It Back, Touch &amp; Go on X; Eraser, Shape Of You, Galway Girl, New Man on Ã·; 2step on =; Curtains and End Of Youth on -) and the teaser of Play tells us Opening is gonna also going to see Ed rapping again.

  
I am personally a huge fan of his rapping, even made a whole [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1cEIGThwJxhUqi08BwWdsP?si=c9ed9d131bab4f52). I'd love to see more. Love the Collaborations side project. And initially in general when we started to find out what the symbols were for the new series I thought it'd be Play, Pause, Next, Back, and Stop. But since they are Fast Forward and Rewind, it got me thinking.

Could Fast Forward be an album of *only* these types of songs. Thematically, it'd make sense. People often dismiss his rapping skills (which he has and high might I add) as ""singing fast"", where better to telling anyone who doubts of those skills than on FAST FORWARD. It objectively makes sense, and if you think about what a lot of his songs I listed above are about, and what an album called Fast Forward sounds about at first thought, it's also entirely in his vibe.

So yeah, I just wanted to get someone else's opinion on this.

Then again, he never made an album that was truly solely these genres that wasn't the collaborations projects (and he tends to not have features on his main albums). So it WOULD be a major step. But also a lot of hiphopheads always said they'll only start taking him seriously when he drops a full rap album. And, well, we don't even have Play yet, we have no idea when Fast Forward would be coming. Just...

2025-04-02,1743604480,Saying goodbye to Mathematics Era.,"I need to get this off my chest and I feel like this is probably the only place that would get it. TW for cancer, unaliving thoughts, trauma, grief and depression and mention of an abusive relationship.

I'm so excited for *Azizam* and **Play** as an album, don't get me wrong. I'm excited for something upbeat and something that brings out the happier side of myself. I mean, just the clips of *Azizam* alone make me dance every time i hear it.

Just, the Mathematics era was such an important part of my life for twelve years. It was the first time a musician had ever made music that described my life, my complex feelings and what it felt like to be in my head. It was the first time in my life I didn't feel like I was alone. Music is my safe place and had been since I was about ten years old. I communicate to others how I feel about them using music. But to have someone finally figure out my mind when I was eighteen and right through to the age of thirty-one, even without knowing me, changed everything. I looked forward to release dates, sitting up each night before, playing the previous albums to prepare for the new drop on Spotify at midnight.

Particularly **Subtract**. **Subtract** changed my life. I lost lots of important people in my life between 2011 and 2023 and until **Subtract**, I'd never had a way of putting my grief into words that people could understand. I'd never been able to express to my parents what was going on in my head and just how scared and alone I had felt for so long. I was thirty and just didn't know how to tell them how much I had been hurting for so long.

The day I shared **Subtract** with my Dad, he finally saw through the facade I had been putting on since I was a teenager. He finally got it. Well, it took two listens. The first time he said, ""Oh yeah the music is beautiful.""  
And my response was, ""Did you listen to the lyrics?"" and he replied with ""Not really. I'm more about the melodies and harmonies. You seem to do life in subtitles.""  
And I told him I needed him to listen to the words. Just once. Particularly *Salt Wate*r, *End of Youth,* *Curtains*, *Borderline and Vega*. Once he did that, it was like everything changed. My family went through another loss in mid 2023, and it was the first time my Dad really made sure to watch me, watch my reactions and emotions because he finally understood what happened in my brain every time I went through a trauma and loss.

I listen to **Subtract** everyday even now, almost two years later. I go between the studio album and the Apple Music Live version. On the days where my anxiety gets the best of me, it'll be all I'll play. I sobbed for days the first time I listened to **Subtract** (it probably didn't help I got drunk to listen to it either because I knew it was going to hit me hard).

**Plus** was the album of my angsty late teens. The days when I felt alone in my first year of university and didn't know how to let new people in. The time when my inner hopeless romantic started coming out. Ed was the one who was able to describe those feelings for me that I didn't quite understand. *Give Me Love* described the moments where I felt alone and unlovable and just wanted someone to notice me. *You Need Me, I Don't Need You* was like my subconscious standing up for myself for once. *Kiss Me* reminded me of one of my university loves. He always played **Plus** when we spent time together, without me even asking.

**Multiply** was the album that described two of the hardest years of my life. I was angry. I was lost. I felt misunderstood. But it also had moments where I found my inner child. *Bloodstream* was the way I could describe to my closest friends what my head felt like when I was in sensory overload - until that song it was a sensation I'd never been able to describe. *Photograph* described my friendship with my best friend better than I ever could. *Tenerife Sea* was the way I longed for someone to describe the way they looked at me.

**Divide** came along when I had got out of my first proper long term relationship at twenty-four. It helped me sit and process, made me realise one day I'd find love like that. Hopefully. *Eraser* was the song I played when I felt angry and like no one understood me. *Happier* described the way I felt when my best friend found a new partner. *Supermarket Flowers* described how it felt to lose my aunty. *Save Myself* was exactly what my mind sounded like on my darkest days.

**Equals**. **Equals** happened four months after I had got out of an abusive relationship, but was also still mourning the loss of my Nanna, three years after it happened. *Visiting Hours* became my anthem. It was all I wanted, to be able to visit my Nanna in heaven and tell her everything I was feeling, everything that was going on. I'd never found a song that conveyed that for me since she had passed in 2018. *Bad Habits* put into words what it was like for me sitting up late at night, alone with my thoughts. *First Times* reminded me that it was okay to try again with someone else. It was an album that slowly started helping me find myself again.

*F64* was what made me realise **Subtract** was going to be important. I call *F64* ""angry Ed"". You can just hear the anger, hurt and grief in his voice when he's rapping. The way he described crying and his lungs aching. It just struck a chord with me. So much so I listen to it every time I'm angry or sad or just need an ARGHHHH kind of song to get those feelings out.

Then there was **Subtract**. I still tell people once they get to know me a little, to listen to **Subtract** if they want to understand how my brain works because I don't know how to explain it properly but that's the closest I can get. *Saltwater* described my head on my very darkest nights. The nights I had been far too scared to tell anyone about. *Life Goes On* explained everything I ever felt about grief in one song. How everyone kept telling me I needed to move on, not stew on things. But my brain doesn't work like that. *End of Youth* explained exactly how 13 year old me felt back in 2007 when my Mum got sick. I knew from that moment on, I had to be a grown up. Even more so in 2013 when I was 20 and my aunty had passed and as the eldest grandchild/niece/daughter, I was expected to take care of everyone else, damn what I was going through. *Curtains and Borderline* described my neurodivergence in a way I never could. The way I always felt like my emotions were too much, like I had to hide them but they were constantly bubbling up and showing themselves. The way my eyes were aways glassy with unshed tears because everything was just too much and I didn't know how to say. *Vega* described my 13 year old self battling with the feelings of my Mum's cancer. Constantly hoping with each scan we would get good news, but for years we didn't. Then when my aunty got cancer, it was like reliving that all over again, especially because looking at her, was like looking at my Mum sick all over again because they looked so similar. *HIlls of Aberfeldy* helped to put my broken heart back together, and ever since May 5 2023, it'll be the song I play when I just need that little bit of hope to keep me going through the day.

I know **Autumn Variations** doesn't count in the Mathematics Era but it was just as important to me in 2023. It helped me navigate the start of a new relationship, even if I wasn't quite ready. It felt a little like **Plus** all over again, with little hints of **Subtract** which I still needed. *Plastic Bag* helped me work through feelings about letting my family down and never quite meeting their expectations. *Head &gt; Heels* helped me navigate the start of a new relationship where I maybe jumped in a little too fast but I was also completely smitten. *American Town* was another song that reminded me of my best friend and I - what our relationship could have been.

Deep down, I know I'm going to love everything about Play. I already love the snippets I've heard of Old Phone, Azizam and Sapphire. It makes me smile, even though right now my head is a mess. It's the one thing keeping me going - knowing there's a new album coming.

At the same time, knowing we're saying goodbye to the Mathematics era just hurts my heart in ways I never expected.",EdSheeran,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/1jpq3nx/saying_goodbye_to_mathematics_era/

2025-06-29,1751209764,Ed played *********** ******* in Stuttgart last night,"Spoiler in case of someone likes to be surprised by the setlist 

Ed played **Supermarket Flowers** at the show in Stuttgart last night and it was so emotional. 

He said he saw someone with a sign that he should play it and Ed said, he didn't play the song in 8 years and didn't listen to it in 7 years as it is so hard and emotional to play and listen to it and once when he played it privately and his mum came in, she started crying. 

But he said, he feels that it is a special night and that the song must mean a lot to the fan who had the sign and sometimes the emotions of others are more important to him than his own emotions and so he played it. 

It was a version just with piano played by his pianist (Stuart???) and Ed's voice. 

And this moment was so amazingly emotional and special! 

After finishing the song Ed started crying into his towel and yes, many, many people including me had tears in our eyes or cried during the song. 

Ed then quickly started playing ""Perfect"" to get other emotions. 

The whole show was just so amazing. So many deep cuts and all the lights and effects and Ed played almost 3 hours. The 2022 show I've been to was great, but this one was like the best show you could imagine!

Im going to Ed Sheeran concert in DÃ¼sseldorf on September 5 and I have a question about the stage plan. Its a 360Â° stage and everybody will have a good view on him. But from YouTube videos one can see that there is still a clear front and back, since the middle non revolving part of the stage has a direction. Maybe the bridge gives some orientation. I guess the best view would be in the section opposite of that bridge (yellow and red) but Id really appreciate your opinion or experience.

Maybe somebody can help based onntje experience with other concerts of the tour.

I can buy tickets for all four inner standing sections: red, green, blue, yellow.

Which one would you recommend if I want to see Ed mostly from the front? 

Thanks a lot in advance!

2025-06-02,1748870478,At what time does the show start?,"Hi everyone =


I'll be at Ed Sheeran's concert in Marseille this weekend, it will be my 3rd time seeing him live but the first time with my (rather young) kids. Living in the area, I know that Marseille has a horrible, horrible traffic especially around the Velodrome on the weekend = and one of my kid has its school fair the same night.

Our ticket says it's starting at 7PM, do you know if Ed is on stage at 7PM? Or is there an opener and the show starts later? So I'll see if I can manage the school fair + coming to Marseille or not.

Thanks :)

Now that I've gotten home and done some research, I'm wondering if I might have actually stumbled upon something a bit special. From what I've seen, there are a few different yellow versions out there, including a ""Deluxe Edition"", which this appears to be. However, from what I've read there were only 5,000 copies made and it seems weird that a random arcade would have one. Does anyone know which specific version this might be just from the cover, or what should look for to confirm if it's one of the more limited ones? l'm not planning on opening if it's rare so l'd like to confirm before doing so.

Anyone else feel this way? Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Equals, Subtract, and Autumn Variations, but I feel like his music just hasn't been the same since the divide era. Something about it feeling less acoustic and overly produced with electronic beats instead of guitar/piano. I'm really hoping the new album will bring us back to the Ed roots of Plus, Multiply, and Divide with his vocals and stray away from the super pop-feeling songs.

2025-06-07,1749338514,Thoughts on the collection (so far!),"Just wanted to share my collection so far (I missed out quite a lot of clothing like hoodies and Christmas jumpers as well as posters/banners because they took up too much space). I was also wondering if anyone had any Ed-related things to look out for next??

I'd love to get all the Sheeran lock cds/vinyls one day, though it may take a while.

I'd also love a signed copy of each album cd. I'm still missing most of them as I'd like the autographs on the actual cd rather than an art card (X, divide, -, =, No. 6 and of course Play).

Then of course there's the guitars. I'll definitely try to get them all one day but they are soooo expensive. I'd also get the loopers to accompany them =	 

I'm going to try to save up for the signed Heinz bottle /150 too, but idk how far I'll make it before I find something else to buy = 

My favourites from my collection are definitely some of the t shirts. Specifically the '-' Eventim one and the Union Chapel FONO shirts as they are so limited and are awesome memories from 2 of the greatest concerts I'll ever go to. I also LOVE my signed '+' album with the headphone winder and the A Team signed vinyl I've got. I've got a handmade bracelet from Imogen Sheeran which I love as well and had to hunt for for a long time! I also bought a suit hanger that Ed donated to charity when he did the EACH eBay thing. I like to imagine that the Bad Habits suit was hung up in this = 

However, the jewel is definitely the Subtract Notebook. I have no idea how many were made, but very few were sent out to select fans before the release of '-' and had special dates highlighted and lyrics printed. I was so lucky to be picked to receive this and I love it so much - it's completely priceless to me.

Can't wait for many more years of collecting!!! ",EdSheeran,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/1l5y3i8/thoughts_on_the_collection_so_far/

2024-12-03,1733189473,My Sheeran Grid (Extended Cut),"Saw everyone else adding eps and collaborations. So I'm hopping on the train.

Most Underrated: I'm Glad I'm Not You
Most people don't even realize this song exists, yet I'd put it in Ed's top 10.

Most Overrated Song: Shape Of You
It's alright just shouldn't be treated as one of his best songs. 

Best Lyrics: The Man
The one song Ed regrets releasing because this is brutal. Both to himself and the woman the song is about.

Most Emotional: Small Bump
Try listing to this after processing the last verse. This song needs a spoiler warning

Most Genius Song: You Need Me, I Don't Need You
This song changes every time it's played live. He even incorporates raps from his lesser known songs into the extended live version. Notably Lately and Move On

Most Hype: The City
Specifically the Loose Change version of the song. The defiance of the song is diluted in the studio recording 

Best Chorus: Castle On The Hill
This chorus feels like coming home after a long time. The first half paints the scene, the second half paints the feeling

Worst Song: Collide
The lyrics are fine, but the instrumental? This is the least Ed Sheeran sounding Ed Sheeran song.

Best Song: The A Team
This is his magnum opus. A weird folk song about drugs and prostitutes that was so good it forced it's way into the main stream

Best Guitar Solo: Boat
This is just so raw. Can't imagine this song with more instrumentation

Best Album Cover: No. 5 Collaborations 
They made Ed look genuinely cool with this pencil sketch style.

Worst Album Cover: No. 6 Collaborations 
It's just most of a big number 6 innit?

Most Underrated Album: Want Some?
I'd rank this in my personal top 3 Ed Sheeran albums but most people don't realize this one exists. My dream Ed Sheeran project is for him to rerecord these old songs so they're all easily accessible 

Most Overrated Album: Divide
It's a good album but seeing so many people rate this as the best album is confusing. Plus and Multiply are right there guys.

Worst Album: Equals
The least Ed Sheeran sounding Ed Sheeran album. Still some gems on the album but theres so much generic pop fluff to sift through.

Best Album: Plus
Written and produced like a big budget indie folk project. It's the raw, unapologetic Ed Sheeran-ness of his early work with the production value of his later work. ",EdSheeran,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/1h5bt6m/my_sheeran_grid_extended_cut/
2025-07-09,1752096281,A Little More is going to be a huge hit (prediction),"It hasnt even been officially announced yet - just leaked on TikTok 
 (Eds team definitely nonchalantly posted it) and they likely are using the TikTok creator fund to secretly market and have influencers use the sound before its even officially announced.

Lots of decent sized influencers are using the sound and its already on videos that have 200k-800k likes on TikTok. 

You can easily find the snippet by looking up A Little More - Ed Sheeran on TikTok.

2025-09-13,1757761434,Behind the Making of Play: the Songwriters &amp; Producers,"Im really glad everyone is enjoying *Play* as much as I am!!! Since its such a diverse album, I thought Id put together a summary &amp; appreciation post about the amazing songwriters and producers who helped Ed make *Play* what it is.

**General fun facts (excluding deluxe/extended version)**

1. *Play* has **18 songwriters &amp; producers combined**! That puts it in 3rd place for most collaborators on Eds main albums (not including Collab projects)  with *Equals* first (21) and *Divide* second (20)
2. The **only song where Ed is the sole songwriter** is *Old Phone*.
3. The song with the **most songwriters is Sapphire (8!)**, partly because it features Indian lyrics, written with Arijit Singh, Avinash Chouhan, and Mayar Puri.
4. *For Always* was originally meant to close the album, giving it the kind of sentimental ending weve seen on most of Eds past records. But *Heaven* was added as track 13 after Cherry (Eds wife) loved the song so much! Hence why this is Eds first album with an odd number of songs. 

**The Eastern Influence: Ilya Salmanzadeh &amp; Savan Kotecha**

The main brains behind the Eastern influence on *Play*! **Ilya** (Persian descent) and **Savan** (Gujarati descent) both brought their cultural touch to all of the Eastern influenced tracks we hear on Play!

Notably, they have both worked with Ariana Grande since the early 2010s, with Ilya also being the main producer of Arianas 2024 Eternal Sunshine (another great album too!). Savan is also behind a few of One Directions big hits: Live While Were Young, One Thing, and Kiss You, to name a few.

Together, they have contributed 7 songs on Play:

* Sapphire
* Azizam
* Old Phone (Ilya only - producer)
* Camera (Ilya only - producer)
* Symmetry
* Dont Look Down (Ilya only)
* Heaven

**Bringing back Eds roots: Blake Slatkin**

In case you didnt know: **Blake Slatkin** was Benny Blancos intern of many years - before starting to write some of this decades biggest hits e.g. Mood by 24kGoldn, Stay by the Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber, About Damn Time by Lizzo, Unholy by Sam Smith.

In Eds interview with Zane Lowe recently released on Apple Music, he told Ed he wanted to hear him bring back some of his older sounds, and you can really hear that influence on:

* Opening
* Old Phone (producer only)
* In Other Words
* A Little More
* Slowly
* The Vow
* For Always

Another producer/songwriter **Omer Fedi** (who worked with Blake on *Mood* etc.) also helped with:

* Opening
* Slowly
* The Vow

You can find a clip of them writing Slowly on Spotify under the Play album!

**Eds rock in songwriting: Johnny McDaid**

Eds long time close friend and frequent collaborator **Johnny McDaid** who Ed has worked with on Multiply, Divide and Equals has once again collaborated with Ed on:

* Sapphire
* Azizam
* Symmetry
* In Other Words (songwriter only)
* A Little More (songwriter only)
* The Vow (songwriter only)
* Heaven 

**Other collaborators:**

**Dave** (yes, the UK rapper) has also collaborated with 2 of the songs on the main album (hmm& which 2 songs could it be?). Interestingly, Ed has mentioned that Opening basically started as a rap battle between him and Dave:

* Opening
* A Little More
* Regrets (deluxe edition)

**Henry Walter** (Cirkut) - notable for his collaborations in tandem with American record producerÂ Dr Luke and Swedish producerÂ Max MartinÂ since 2008 has helped Ed with writing and producing:

* Opening
* In Other Words
* A Little More

Another three very influential songwriters/producers: **David Hodges, Andrew Watt, and Louis Bell** collaborated with Ed on Camera!Â  Its actually the only track on *Play* written and produced solely by the four of them. Between the three, theyve shaped some of the biggest songs of the past two decades, so if youre curious about their impact, Id definitely recommend looking up their credits; Im sure youll recognize more than just a few!

However, this isnt the first time they collaborated with Ed - they four of them worked together on *2step* before! And David Hodges was also one of the songwriters of *First Times* and *Afterglow.*

Speaking of *Equals*, Swedish producer **Elvira AnderfjÃ¤rd** returns on *Dont Look Down*. She was the main producer of *Leave Your Life!* Interestingly, she also is the main producer and helped with songwriting on *War Games* and *Problems* (deluxe edition).

**Fred Again..** also makes a comeback as songwriter and producer on *Dont Look Down*. I was honestly surprised albeit happy to see his name at first, although it does make sense production wise (still a banger though!)! He was Eds main collaborator from 2018-2023: being the main producer of *Equals*, and having worked on several tracks from *No.6 Collaborations* (notably *I Dont Care, Beautiful People*), *Afterglow*, and *Eyes Closed.*

Finally, one of my favorite songwriters of all time: **Amy Allen**, the person behind many of todays hits: notably Sabrina Carpenters *Espresso, Please Please Please, Taste,* Harry Styles *Adore You*, *APT* by Bruno Mars and RosÃ© to name a few - collaborated with Ed for the first time on *Forever Always*! One of the best songs on the album, I love how its such a lovely message for Eds daughters.

In *Freedom* (deluxe edition), **Steve Mac** makes a return as main producer and songwriter of the song! He has notably written *Shape of You, Shivers and Celestial* with Ed.

Also fun fact: *Crashing*s guitar solo is by **John Mayer**, who also plays guitar on *Drive* alongside **Dave Grohl** (of Nirvana and Foo Fighters) on the drums.

***Why am I sharing this?*** Im sure Play will hold a special place for everyone here, Ive seen posts and comments about how its up there with Multiply (which I wholeheartedly agree) and I feel its only great if we acknowledge the great people who helped made this fantastic album with Ed! I hope this gave a bit more insight into the songs and showed how much the songwriters and producers contribute to shaping Eds music direction. Who knows, maybe Ed will release more BTS footage like he did with the singles, and now youll have a better idea of whos who when you watch it!

**Here are the previous BTS in the studio videos you can watch, just in case you missed it!**

I know I discussed this with someone on here a while back when Ed released the live video of Azizam. But it looks like this is some kind of extension to his Looper X that I would say gives him an extra 2 tracks on top of the existing 4 tracks that you get. I know that in the past when Ed has played Bad Habits, he had to bank the existing 4 tracks to record the lead keyboard bit and have his loop pedal technician remotely trigger it when it was time to play it. Perhaps hes using this new extension pedal so he can trigger it himself on stage and not have to rely on someone else to do it. Or he just fancies having 6 tracks to build more complex loops and have more control on what parts of the song he can drop in and out?",EdSheeran,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/1ljj4al/clearest_picture_of_the_expansion_of_eds_looper_x/

I've been listening to Ed Sheeran on repeat for the past week. I went out with a girl from my class in school and it went really well. I can't stop thinking about her and I've decided to dive headfirst into my emotions by listening to Ed Sheeran. I truly believe that Ed Sheeran is the king of modern love songs and no one (besides Taylor Swift) can touch him in this area of music. 

Afire Love is about Ed's grandfather passing away and it's not exactly a classic love song like Perfect or Thinking Out Loud. However, the chorus is extremely romantic. 


Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love 

This is love at it's very best. Pure poetry and magic when it comes to feeling love. Just wow...",EdSheeran,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/1j1uo6a/i_find_this_one_of_ed_sheerans_most_romantic/

So I went looking and found an account that totally fits the bill! It has 619 reviews and they seem wel written so I don't think it can be someone pretending to be him. It also has a subscription and currently is at 4213 followers (Ed said he didn't have any, but I guess some people beat me to it?)

Ed also said that people will find it now, so i think it's fine if I post this? This is what he said:

""Well, I guess theyll find out now. I think its more fun for people to find it""

By the way, if you think it isn't fine, please let me know, cause im not the best at reading the room lol. I'll delete it if we agree that's best.

The account is called tedsmovies and nicknamed Teddy with a profile picture of the emperor. I found it searching for tedsmovies, but here is a link as well

2025-08-10,1754865176,Ed Sheeran's Loop Pedals,"Every so often I go down a rabbithole of learning about Ed Sheerans loop station. Over the years I havent found a single resource that covers how the pedal has evolved, so here is what I know.Â 



If youre interested in seeing how Ed uses the pedal to build loops. Youtube channel Brody Oliver Bassett has some fantastic visualizations that show all the pedal clicks. [https://www.youtube.com/@brodyoliverbassett7579/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@brodyoliverbassett7579/videos)



First Pedal: BOSS RC-20XL



This was the very first pedal that Ed is seen to have been using. Its a standard pedal created by BOSS. He uses it for his first few shows, see here: [https://youtu.be/lCsKMDTG88o?si=pNHTTFFWbeNDDDSn](https://youtu.be/lCsKMDTG88o?si=pNHTTFFWbeNDDDSn)



2011-2016 - The Chewie Monsta



This was Eds first custom pedal, once he started playing larger venues they needed something that could work with uncompressed audio. It was created by his guitar tech Trevor Dawkins and looks like an array of BOSS twin pedals. It essentially acted as a midi controller for Mobius VST hosted in Ableton. If you look closely at the pedals HUD you can see the Mobius VST. Apparently Chewie Monsta controls a Roland FC-300 MIDI controller offstage, which in turn controls the free Mobius 2 VST, a looper plugin run on Ableton Live.



2017-2019 - Chewie II Pedal



Chewie II was the successor to the Chewie Monsta, the housing and build of the pedal looked a lot more refined and it was running a custom Chewie VST in Ableton. Here is an excellent video with his pedal technician, David White, breaking down how the setup works: [https://youtu.be/tjUKD4tuFMc?si=O9NSG3QYibzEjqwp&amp;t=341](https://youtu.be/tjUKD4tuFMc?si=O9NSG3QYibzEjqwp&amp;t=341)



Here is an article about the development of it: [https://www.wearemobilefirst.com/projects/ed-sheerans-loop-pedal-chewie-ii](https://www.wearemobilefirst.com/projects/ed-sheerans-loop-pedal-chewie-ii)

  


Current Setup: 2022-2024 Sheeran Looper



Ed uses 5 identical loop stations on stage, one in the centre and 4 that rotate on the revolving outer stage. This is a custom looper which acts as a remote for a custom VST plugin that runs in Ableton live. Here is another walkthrough with his Loop technician David White: [https://youtu.be/HvLCHaR4RbY?si=2MRgAaCFLAgkaRbm&amp;t=871](https://youtu.be/HvLCHaR4RbY?si=2MRgAaCFLAgkaRbm&amp;t=871)



Notable others: In early 2024 Ed released his own commercially available custom loopers which were developed in collaboration with Headrush. These loopers (Sheeran Looper X and Looper +) are fully integrated systems which can be used independently of a computer system. So in some cases where Ed cant setup his full stage looper he uses these. For example, in his Delhi rooftop videos: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNPJBHUePl0&amp;ab\_channel=EdSheeran](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNPJBHUePl0&amp;ab_channel=EdSheeran)

I'm still upset but ""Save Myself"" helped calm me down and I can't help but wonder if that song just saved my life. I was feeling awful and it's such a comforting song. 

Anyways, rant over. I just wanted to tell that story just in case it helps anyone else here.

2025-07-18,1752806800,I'm using Ed's music to treat my medical condition!,"The reason I'm writing about this is to spread awareness of this life-changing, misunderstood, and traumatic medical condition I have and how I'm managing it using Ed Sheeran's music. I'm hoping that this might help others going through what can seem like hell. d

For context, I have a condition that's often called both ""the most common condition you've never heard of"" and ""the most common disorder you've never heard of."" That condition? FND, a.k.a Functional Neurological Disorder and formally known as Conversion Disorder. It is actually a rather common condition but it oftentimes gets misdiagnosed or overlooked. It is a condition in which, for one reason or another, the brain is confused (but you don't even realize it) and the brain gets used to sending wrong signals to the body. If you look up the symptoms I have all of them except for blindness (thank G-d). But basically this condition causes stuff like absent-like seizures, tics, wheezing, paralysis, body pain, etc.  pretty much anything that's abnormal for you. 

The treatment I'm doing emphasizes practice. During a trigger I need to do the opposite action my body wants to do and eventually that symptom will pretty much go away. This is where Ed's music has helped me. Here are some triggers and songs I'm using to help treat my FND symptoms from these triggers. I hope this helps anybody else!

For screaming: ""BLOW"" and ""Drive"" (I'm going to listen to ""Drive"" soon because I've head there is screaming and I haven't heard it yet but screaming is a trigger).

Chaos: The bridge in ""I Don't Care.""

Skips/static/unnatural sounds: the record skipping sound at the end of ""New Man.""

If you're using any of Ed's songs to help treat FND or some other condition and you're comfortable sharing (or you can DM me if that's more comfortable) with me, I'll make a note in case if I need it later.

I've adjusted the description as people have asked questions, so check here for answers first! Thanks!

Sheerios! I'm doing a poll for every single Ed Sheeran song that's on a mathematics album, #6 collaborations album, and Autumn Variations with the standard track listing and the standard deluxe track listing. I decided which songs would be ""against"" each other by track listing. For example, ""Beautiful People"" and ""South of the Border"" are tracks 1 and 2 on the collaborations album, so they would go against each other.

If you could take just 3\~ minutes out of your day to vote on this poll and the following polls, I will highly appreciate it! (The more votes, the better!!)

It should autosave if you need to come back to it later. I will be closing responses on this poll on Friday, April 25th in the US and I'll post the poll for = on that day as well.

If you don't know either song well enough to make an opinion, please skip it.

Also, I did add ""Azizam"" lol. I don't know if I'm going to add it on the diagram I'll make later, it will probably go into its own separate category because it's not part of an album thus far and is so new but I added it to make an even number.

Feel free to share this form with others. As I said earlier, the more votes, the better!

2025-05-07,1746619617,"Why ""Give Me Love"" Might Just Be Ed's Best Music Video","I think its safe to say that Give Me Love is one of Ed Sheeran's best songsand maybe even his best.

Personally, its in my top five. For me, Tenerife Sea takes the top spot, followed by Afire Love, with Castle on the Hill and Photograph coming in at four and five.

But Im not here to debate top fives. I want to talk about the Give Me Love music video because I think its a masterpiece.

Theres one part that stands out to me the most: the 3:33 mark.

Thats where the crescendo starts. Eds falsetto builds gradually, stretching out before collapsing into this raw, desperate cry for love. You can hear the vulnerability in his voice as he repeats those three words over and over. And it hit me that those wordsGive me lovecould just as easily be I love you. Its all about wanting love and needing it back.

Now, about that 3:33 mark. In numerology, 333 is supposed to symbolise creativity, growth, and even divine guidance. Its seen as a sign to trust your intuition and embrace new chances.

That idea actually fits well with the music video. It got me thinking about Cupids choice to take her own life with her arrow. Beyond the desperation, maybe it was also about trusting herself, believing that through that act, shed finally find the love she was searching for.

And she does, in a way. At the end of the video, she wakes up, and the arrow is gone. She sees the investigatorthe person shes meant to love, the one whos meant to love her back. Its almost like it was meant to happen.

They all knew of my love of THE Ron Weasley, so I was bombarded not even just on Tumblr, but Twitter and Facebook too (but Tumblr is where it all started.)

I remember watching the video and giggling like a school girl watching my mans sing his heart out... until I realized he wasn't actually singing. And then the gum scene in the video happened and I was just like ""WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?!"" 

And that was my first introduction to Ed Sheeran. I had no idea how that collaboration would change my life. I couldn't have known that the next near fourteen years of my life would consist of becoming a loud Sheerio and listening to ever bit of Ed's music I could find, old and new, and seeing him live every single chance I got (eight times and counting! As long as he's touring, I'm there!)

(Off subject, but I first saw Ed live in Nashville January 2013 at the Ryman Auditorium with my best friend. He only played +. Ten years and six months later, July 2023, we saw him again in Nashville at the Nissan Stadium where he played all five math albums.

2025-09-15,1757962248,Play Review,"*Hey everyone, on September 12, 2025, Ed Sheeran released his first album in the stereo era, titled Play. Im here today to discuss the new project and share my thoughts on it. First, Ill break down the artist and explain the relationship with the singer. Then Ill look at the singles, and Ill also talk about the B-sides. We will conclude this post with a summary that consolidates all my thoughts. Now, lets jump in and see what my thoughts on Play are.*Â 



*I remember hearing the A Team when I was 13 years old, and that song was different from the style of music I was enjoying at that time. It took me a little bit for that song to grow on me, but when it did, I was obsessed. Plus was an album that expanded my musical horizon into something that was different from what I was listening to in 2011. Lego House was another one of my favorites on the project that I remember coming back to a lot. When Ed released Multiply, I was 16, and I remember being obsessed with that album. I enjoyed songs like New York, Thinking Out Loud, and Take It Back. By the time Divide came out, I was 19, but I didnt care for the album because Shape of You turned me off from listening, as it sounded way too generic. I remember not being into Western music at that time, because I was a big K-pop fan. When Equales released, I was 24 years old and remember my work kept playing Bad Habits like crazy, which made me wonder who was singing that song, cause it kept getting stuck in my head like crazy. Equales was the album that got me back into Ed, and the time I re-listened to all his albums he had at the time. I did enjoy Subtract when it released, as it helped me get through a tough time in 2023. Im glad Ed returned to my life, and now we have Play for his new era. What do I think of it?*Â   


  
The first single from the album was Azizam, a repetitive dance-pop track that pulled me right in. It did take me a few listens to fully get into the song, but now I love it for its catchy verses and chorus. We did get a Persian version with Googoosh, and that version has been on repeat. I love hearing Ed sing in Persian as he sounds pretty good speaking the language. Ed released the acoustic version and a remix done by D.O.D, both of which Ive been listening to a lot. The second single was Old Phone, reminding me of plus. The acoustic vibe blends with Eds emotion, which helped the song grow on me. The third single was Sapphire, which didnt take long to become one of my favorite singles from the album. I love that Ed mixed in Indian music influences into the music, adding a new vibe to Eds music. The unplugged version switches things up, adding more indian instruments to the track, which I enjoyed. Now Ill tell you Im not into Indian music, but the Arijit Singh version has been on repeat since it was released, cause I cant get it out of my head. The last single we got before Play released was A Little More. I havent been listening to that one a lot, but maybe since the album is out, Ill start listening to it a lot. I enjoyed the singles that were released from Play, but Im curious what the rest of the album will be like.Â 

  
Now its time to jump into the album and see what I think of the non-singles. Dont Look Down is this synth-pop EDM sounding tune that Ive seen growing on me. I did hear someone on Discord say that the song reminded them of background music from WII Party. Opening is a great start to the album,Â pulling us into the subtrack world before switching up the beat into a Play sound. Â The Vow reminds me of Thinking Out Loud which is one track from Multiply that I enjoy. Symmetry might be one of my favorite non-singles as it has this thumping indian beat that blends wonderfully with the vocals. Heaven has vocal effects that I wasnt enjoying at first, but the more I hear it, the more I like the way it closes out the album. The Extended edition adds four bonus songs that add to the album. War Games has a Bollywood vibe that Ive been enjoying like crazy. Freedom closes out the extended edition perfectly, being another favorite of mine. The more I hear this album, the more it grows on me. I love the way the record opens to the closer that ties everything together on the standard addition. I do wish for a little more upbeat songs, but I think like all the tunes off this record. I wonder how Ill feel about this record a couple of years from now, but at the moment Im enjoying it for what it is.Â 

What do you guys think of Play? What are your favorite songs from the project? I like the Â album and am curious to see what the rest of the Stereo Era will be bringing to the table. Im glad Ed is back with a new project that has been on repeat since it was released. I had a good time looking at the Ed album and I cant wait for the next project.Â ",EdSheeran,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/EdSheeran/comments/1nhui65/play_review/
