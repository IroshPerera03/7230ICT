I will say even though they went up in price I will agree they are still pricer than normal but probably the cheapest of all ticket prices for ANY major artist! But thats just what Ive noticed and I concerts are my thing! Yeah they are more expensive but like if that was like any other artist I feel it would be 3 to 4 times the prices!

I was hoping for that this time but got row 7 in the second set of sections in the center, 2 seats in and near the mini stage in the center. So im okay with that. 

I was really hoping he had the rotating stage again as I loved sitting further up in the stands and knowing that he would rotate by eventually each song. 

The floor is a pain at Gillette as they let everyone go up to get food and stuff but then it takes like 40 min to go back down... meanwhile they could just take a set of stairs to the edge of the stage and make that down only...

But regardless of seats, im excited! This will be my 5th time seeing Ed!

I get releasing a song or two as singles in the months leading up to an album's official release. That makes sense. But this whole concept of literally releasing half the album before the official release date just does not sit well with me and it honestly has kind of put a damper on my excitement for Play. I actually really enjoy the experience of binging an album's track list once it comes out. And it's nice to know one or two of those songs ahead of time. It's such a special moment to press play on a tracklist of 12+ tracks and experience the whole thing new at one time. (I mean Subtract in numerical order is essentially a whole narrative of Ed and his family's journey through that tough stretch and wouldn't nearly have been as inpactful or meaningful if half the songs had randomly been released beforehand!). But with Play we already now have essentially half the album (and most likely the half that is expected to be most popular. Think A side tracks vs B side tracks theory). 
I think this kind of release schedule honestly kind of hurts Ed and the album in the long run (and maybe even loop tour). Sure he can bank all of the streaming numbers and money from merch drops now before the album has even officially come out, but what's this going to mean when Play finally releases? The market (fans, streaming) have now been so oversaturated in Play promo, singles, and merch for months that by the time the rest of the album drops next month, is ""anyone even going to care""? (To put it bluntly). 
And in some ways I could even see the argument being made against Ed saying that this type of singles releasing makes him look desperate and even is a bit of a money grab. 
This is just my own unpopular opinion. But I really hope that by the time we're coming up on the next album that Ed and his team have had a good think on the subject and do not follow this same pattern again.",14,Whats your unpopular Ed Sheeran opinion?,"What's one opinion you have, which most people wouldn't agree with but you **strongly** believe in.

Even though he claims he isnt now, there was a time he embraced chart topping, as said by the song Tides from Equals.

The other unpopular opinion I have is that Ed actually never did try to replicate the success of Divide. He had yet to make an album that is full of what couldve been singles. Divide was an album full of songs Ed claimed couldve been a single. None of his *solo* albums since have been that.

Firstly, Ive been a die-hard since about 2010. All the EPs, all the albums, and I love him. This is the man who got me into songwriting, so credit where credits due. 

I remember being completely infatuated by his early lyrics- especially from SIWWA right up until the deluxe versions of X. There was a rawness to his storytelling- you could really feel the emotion in his vocals. The production wasnt too overwhelming and managed to just amplify these amazing amazing songs so much so that they are still perfect to listen to. 

Then Divide drops, the world goes crazy and he becomes this almost ubiquitous figure- and not just in music. Hes everywhere. SOY plays about 100 times on any radio station and he becomes inescapable. That marimba line is one of the most recognisable melodies in modern pop and I love it at the same time as I hate it, because lyrically, its a weak song. 
Granted, it got people up and dancing, and the Fresh Meat reference was an ode to Britishness, but for me it just lacked everything I fell in love with. 
Perfect was always going to be a hit, but even that didnt feel like it had half the soul of Wake me up, photograph or Afire Love. It had no vulnerability. 

No6 had some great collabs but there was nearly a video every other week, and I feel like people were kind of like thanks for the songs for the summer and it was relegated to the shelf. 

Then = is announced and I have hope. Hope which is snatched as soon as I hear Shivers. A great bop, but the lyrics felt so bland it was like pop-music-korma. Overpass Graffiti is brilliant but it should have had the same type of production quality as Nina because the triple guitar tracking was too much, but the lyrics felt personal- finally! 

- was an absolute belter, and one of my favourite releases to date. The lyrics were poignant, heartfelt and you could really finally feel the man behind the music again. However, I still think for an acoustic album, the production quality was over the top. He should have recorded that album with Jake Gosling, as he did with +, not Aaron Dessner. Almost like the studio said this is great, but we still need it to be semi-commercial 

Autumn Variations gets an honourable mention, and Plastic Bag should have done something commercially- the only song with great lyrics which could have fared well had it had the overproduction of all the other singles. 

Right now, Azizam and sapphire have been okay to listen to when they appear on shuffle, but I am LIVING for A little more. It feels authentic. It doesnt meet the universal convention of a good pop song, but IT IS! Its tongue in cheek, its funny, the lyrics are honest- its great to hear Ed Rap again and its a breath of fresh air. Its been on repeat constantly. 

I sound like Ive come to shit on an entire decades worth of work, but thats not the case at all. I love Ed, I just believe that Shape of You has had him shackled for 8 years in the pop machine, and hes finally starting to break free, which is liberating as a listener.",29,Whats your unpopular Ed Sheeran opinion?,"What's one opinion you have, which most people wouldn't agree with but you **strongly** believe in.

I had written a song with a friend of mine and I was super happy with it but I'm so glad we spent (and are still spending) so much time having it ""on the shelf"" to go back as time goes by and make little adjustments to make it sound the most heartfelt, relatable whilst also personal possible. 

But I also think there is some bias on my thoughts about ""Azizam"" because the eighth notes in the song sound EXACTLY like one of the songs I had to play for marching band. Even the rhythm is the same and whilst I'm 99% sure it was a coincidence because the notes are common value, it has common instruments, common rhythm, etc. I just cannot listen to that song without thinking of the marching band song lol.",9_1,Any thoughts on the new single Azizam?,I personally like the song but thinks its a little to repetitive but its fine,EdSheeran

I dont like short songs in general, but I REALLY dislike short songs that are lead singles. 2step, sure, its a little bottle rocket song that wasnt a lead. But its a fun little song.

But Azizam needed a bridge imo, its way too short and sometimes the bridge can really make a song: Shivers bridge for example is amazing.

Really, really needed to be longer tbh. 

I kind of hope this album isnt catered to TikTok short viral songs. I dont think Ed will do that but I miss long 3, even 4 minute lead songs

Azizam just sort of feels half finished due to lack of bridge. Its fun and light, but probably my least favorite single of his.

Mine isn't even a scenario where I wish he'd go back to his acoustic roots and recapture that spark (that's pretty much impossible), plus he did 2 lo-fi albums back to back that had some incredible writing imo.

I think it's a normal part of growing up tbh, expanding your sonic palette and what not. He is definitely one of the most talented musicians out there. He can wield a pen quite a bit but I feel like his arc as an artist pretty much culminated? If that makes sense. He was a lost teenager dealing with young heartache, the addict in his 20s working harder to make it big, the global superstar that had the highest grossing tour ever, the man that settled down, got married and had kids, and the man that dealt with painful loss and came out alive in the end.

But I guess that's just how things go. Plus Ed won't come back. The edgy multiply won't be coming back. His discography has changed because he's in a better environment now, and he wasn't as rugged as before- buskin all night and grinding for years.  My theory is that, or as obviously, because of this mega success and acclaim he's gotten these late years (all love to ed), there's no intensity anymore in his albums- no sheer musical hunger, and that is not an insult to his recent music at all.",28_3,Any thoughts on the new single Azizam?,I personally like the song but thinks its a little to repetitive but its fine,EdSheeran

He can be clever and drop the second single at his coechella set.  
As for the song,I like it but it's not playing a lot with the lyrics even for pop songs standards.and it's biggest problem is that it's short, maybe a rap verse or something would've made this better.or he should've released the full farsi remix as the main song.",58,Any thoughts on the new single Azizam?,I personally like the song but thinks its a little to repetitive but its fine,EdSheeran

And it clearly states that you can't get things signed so I wouldn't bother. The one thing I am curious about is how long the even will be since it didn't specify at all.

Almost everything he said is the same statements other critics have said on pages like Pitch Fork

And theres a whole point thats built of an assumed intention. Ed looks at charts and cares how his music performs and what music is popular. That doesn't mean every song is written with this supposed intention to be the next big thing. But maybe this is the music he enjoys making? Maybe this is his form of art? Who are you to say what art is? If a painter decided they wanted to paint the most impressive art piece and the measure of how great the art piece is for them is how many people go to look at it in an art gallery is that to say they aren't creating it with artistic passion? And does that mean it's all a money hungry spend as little time as possible kinda thing?

Like there is so much assumed that it's forging a story for the sake of proving this point you came up with, rather than coming up with your opinion (or your point) by looking at the story.

If you look at Old Phone's lyrics and look at lines like  
""Nostalgia trying to pull me astray  
Maybe I'll unwrite some wrongs""

You'll see that the depth and image created is on par with some of Taylor swifts best lyrics on more recent songs... so maybe we could compare 1:1

I'm sure you don't want me comparing those lyrics to ""I'm so obssed with him but he avoids me like the plague"" which really doesn't do what she's saying Ed needs to do while literally telling us straight up she liked this guy who's now gone from her life

It's like meh lyrics. I'm not trying to say old phone is a masterpiece it's lyrics as a whole are on the weak end but come on at least compare reasonably rather than pulling the generic lines from the chorus compared to some specific lines from the verse of some of her best songs

The whole subtract and AV being a rip off of two of Taylors albums is also the most bs take I've heard. Subtract fell out of what was going to be him making AV, he wrote 5 songs in 2 and a half hours because it was him writing about what he felt in one take, cuz thats his raw emotion. Subtract didn't come to be followed by the evermore in AV, it happened by happening. Simple as. No it wasn't some big come back story, if it was he'd at least promote the albums and push them along so the world could here this supposedly factory reset version of Ed.

The lack of substance followed by stories and critisms forged over personal belief rather than actual fact is so disgusting. And the complete insensitivty towards subtract is just not okay. I don't think Ed is a perfect lyricist but at least come with a reasonable argument rather than getting pissed off by the most irrelevant things and trying to claim deeper meaning behind a nice comment Ed left (what he was actually meaning was it's okay if you don't like it doesn't bother me I enjoy making the music I make but if you like this maybe you'll like old phone, which is a reasonable comment to make considering he's someone who doesn't like the idea of music critics to begin with)",28,This man is so evil,"He's basically ranting about why ed sheeran is not a pop diva , why's he wearing cargo pants and why he doesn't have iconic pap moments??

Also to say Eds career is down the drain right now as a TS diehard is INSANITY. 

All of his criticisms of Ed caring about his chart success, I have to agree with you on is soooo insane but also hypocritical. Does he really think Ed is the only pop artist in the world to do that? Oh wait as a TS fan they 100% support TS doing it and have no problem with it. 

This is coming off as a lot of TS bashing but I love Taylors music I just was shocked looking at the comment section and how many fellow TS fans are apparently blind to who TS is as a business woman. Like come on people.

Also I will say I love more soulful artists as well and I think Eds music has a lot more overlap with indie artists and smaller level pure craft artists. He has the more commercial sound with it but you can hear the craft and consideration and soul put into the songs at the same time.

I really enjoy Ed Sheeran. John Mayer is my main man and a musical genius, but before you all beat me up I'm going somewhere with this... JM is objectively a guitar virtuoso acknowledged by leading guitarists and tours with Dead and Co. He got asked about Ed Sheeran in an interview and he stood up for him. Said ES getting associated with Uber/taxi music was basically a symptom of his success and didn't mean people should be hating on the guy for using tried and true musical tactics like certain chord progressions that sound certain ways to the ear to draw someone in. Said ES does it really well because he's talented and doesn't deserve the hate he gets. And that's from a guitar virtuoso. 

I'm with him. I LOVE disappearing into ES's music.  His voice is great and his songs catch me in multiple ways. Some are thoughtful, some are bangers, and some I just play over and over when I discover them until I'm chill enough I can just save them to a playlist and leave them be. 

There's so much nuance to music and so WHAT if he uses common chord progressions? Sometimes it's what you do with those that count.",35,This man is so evil,"He's basically ranting about why ed sheeran is not a pop diva , why's he wearing cargo pants and why he doesn't have iconic pap moments??

In X Sing was the first song Ed released which was specifically written to be a hit. Well, at least it sounded that way. I wasnt very fond of sing. It was obvious the place this song came from was not genuine- compared to give me love, A team, Im a mess, Nina, saltwater etc etc.  When a song is written to be a hit it just loses something. Well Ed had great success with sing and I feel this success changed his view on songwriting in general because after this point it feels like he wrote a lot of songs with the same vision of songwriting that sing was written. and I dont know if anyone else noticed- but why is plus the most musically expansive album? The songwriting is unique, the chords  and positions they are played give different sounds- why did the songwriting become so much more simple and rely on the same four chords with a capo?. The songwriting should become more interesting and unique over time- but when you start writing songs with making a hit song in mind you lose the essence of why you wrote songs in the first place. When you are a kid sitting with your guitar after a bad day, or writing about a new life experience the LAST thing you are thinking about is writing a hit song. 
That is what makes a good song. Not how many views on YouTube it gets, or sales. After X, Ed seems to have lost that view on music. He has stated many times in interviews that the views means the songs are good- yes that is true if you are just writing pop songs. But now its like sing over and over again.

I'm sorry if this is too off topic or a waste of time, I just like this community a lot and it gave me a chance to vent.

I have a pair of General Admission (pitch standing) tickets for Sunday 13th July at Portman Road, Ipswich which I bought from Ticketmaster. However I have realised that since my daughter is under 14 she won't be admitted for safety reasons to the standing area.

I am wondering if there is anyone here with a pair of seated tickets, ideally for the same date, who would actually prefer standing and would be interested in swapping? Of course I am happy to pay the face value difference. I've read that the swap can only be done legitimately via Ticketmaster to avoid ticket touts, but perhaps this can be coordinated somehow.

In terms of parking, there is a car park next to the ground on Portman Road, but that will be very busy (as it is on match days). The ITFC website has good insights on parking. 

If not, Crown Street multi-storey Car park might be open late enough (its owned by the council - so perhaps check the Ipswich Borough Council website). Thats a ten min walk away. Foundation Street multi-storey car park is also close by, and could be an option,

If you are happy for a longer walk, you could look at Just Park for locations such as Holiday Inn Ipswich or Tesco Copdock Interchange.

2A. Plus sometimes feels like my favorite especially when it comes to how lyrically detailed &amp; tender the album feels. 

2B. I actually think Subtract is super beautiful as well, really sad though.

3. Divide is great &amp; around the same level as Multiply but a few songs toward the end of the regular album kind of make me not like it as much personally, the deluxe songs are fantastic though. Its one of those albums you think of as fun &amp; realize that there are a decent amount of sad songs

4. No. 6 I just love how Ed shows his chameleonic ability to push his sounds. Its so fun, Put It All On Me &amp; How To Break My Heart are so good

5. Equals is not my favorite of his albums but I do have to say playing it in the car takes it to another level AND I think it has the best deluxe! One Life, Penguins, I Will Remember You are all super beautiful &amp; move me. So if including the deluxe I could bump it up

I like all of his albums a lot, Multiply just feels absolutely perfect. Structure &amp; flow of the album is just awesome",53,Whats your favourite album ?,"I personally am still trying to pick between divide , x , =  .",EdSheeran

In America, Nickelodeon (on TeenNick) and Nick Cannon used to do a weekly show called Top 10 or something like that where they would play the top 10 music videos from that week. One time, they played Lego House when I tuned in. I became obsessed with that song but I didnt know much about music and celebrities and stuff. Streaming wasnt a thing yet, so this was all I had to consume music (my mom didnt allow me to buy anything like that when i was younger, we didnt have a record player and I didnt have a phone, so these weekly edition and MTV and 106 and Park, etc were the only ways I consumed music).

So anyway, Lego House reached #1 on the show at one point but then eventually it dropped off and I knew the song by heart. 

Another year passes before I hear of Ed Sheeran again, this time its on Taylor Swifts Everything Has Changed. EHC was not my first experience with TS, but it was when I became a fan of her as well, so you could imagine as a 9 year old boy how impactful it was for me to see them together and doing great. I would argue that Ed Sheeran not only made me a Sheerio but also a Swiftie as well&that song really went on for me to discover Red (22, WANEGBT, and IKYWT also got on that music video list as well eventually, 22 was the favorite for me, but anyway). Eventually, Ed drops more projects and songs.

What shocked me about Ed has his vulnerability and vocal delivery, its why I love him. After years of now collecting music from all genres, and also seeing him live, I realize how great his pen is. Lego House will always be a sentimental song to me. Also that little English white boy can rap lol, so when he was spitting on LH, it was love at first listen. At an early age, I feel like he taught me a lot and to respect music and talent. Id never disrespect Ed in anyway bc Ive followed his career in every era. Hes a great lad to see live and to even just hear talk.

I remember thinking that it was obviously a prank since these can't be real lyrics from a ""lyrical genius."" 

  
My friend snapped back and said Ed has a bunch of songs that are poorly written, to which I responded I couldn't think of any, let alone an entire album that was poorly written.

A lot of mine (melody, lyrics, or both) come to me in like 15 min. I just dont have a team of people to converse with and record things on the fly. I do the same thing he does, esp in terms of spitting out lyrics. You rhyme and play with words and melodies until it sticks. It was cool to see someone else do this too. I know Taylor Swift does this too. I have no issue with the song and love it. 

While its short and missing a more in depth bridge, Im ok with that bc if we as songwriters always have to stick to verse 1, pre chorus, chorus, verse 2, chorus, bridge, chorus again, end, it constrains you musically. I have several songs that have no bridge and I wouldnt change them. Just my two cents for a different perspective. =",10_2_2,Azizam is amazing,Out at midnight in NZ,EdSheeran

I think the ideal for me would be a mix where you don't hear the crowd so loudly while the artist is singing (like it is in Noah's) but they're more present when the artist cuts out to let them sing/cheer.
